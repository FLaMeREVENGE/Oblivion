# SASS-project-tutorial
This is a site created and inspired from a YT exercise by Brian Design:
### "Build a Responsive Website Using HTML & SASS/SCSS Tutorial"
### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-MEjUINjI&ab_channel=BrianDesign

Thanks to this exercise, I quickly learned the principles of SASS design. Besides, the site is not that big and it brought me a lot of fun.

Thank you Brian Design :)
